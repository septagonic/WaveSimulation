# WaveSimulation
Neat little MATLAB wave simulation

No packages are required beyond MATLAB default.

WaveDemo: Demonstrates the simulation with a parabolic reflector and sinusoidal wave
StepWave: RK4 numerical integrator for the wave equation. This is the core of the thing.
DampedBorder: Creates a matrix of damping coefficients which work well.

Everything's mostly explained in comments.
